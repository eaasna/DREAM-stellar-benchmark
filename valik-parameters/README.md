TODO: if IBF size very small then bin-query version of Valik takes a long time. 

Testing the effect of IBF size and pattern overlap on Valik prefiltering performance:
1. Activate snakemake conda environment and add Valik to $PATH
2. Run `./run_snakemake.sh`
3. In `/scripts` directory open interactive session with `jupyter notebook` to visualise results.
